# odin-recipes
This project will showcase different recipes from all around the web.
In order to display them on this page I will have to set up a page, maybe multiple,
with boilerplate code to get them to display the HTML correctly. Each category of recipe will have a header and will be shown in a list. The list items will be anchors that link to the recipe webpage or maybe images that are clickable which link there.
So I will be using all kinds of HTML elements an their attributes.
